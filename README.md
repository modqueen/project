# Local Installation
If you already have RVC installed, then just download GUI.py and drop it in the root folder!
If you need to install RVC, I recommend you check the [original repo](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI)
Or read this at least.

I recommend you use a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv RVC
cd RVC
git clone https://github.com/modqueen/project
Scripts/activate.bat
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install -r "project/requirements.txt"
```
